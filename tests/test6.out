     ...In such a night
     Achilles thus the king of men addressed.
     An honorable murderer, if you will;
     And Let us worship God, he says, with solemn air.
     And anon, sire,
     And fountains spouted in the shade.
     And how it pleaseth well,
     And saw the lion's shadow ere himself.
     And the red field was won;
     And torrents dash'd, and rivulets play'd,
     Antony: I shall remember:
     As much as we this night have overwatched!
     Avengers of their native land.
     Be gay securely;
     Before the Frenchmen speak a word of it.
     Before these fields were shorn and till'd,
     Bleeding at every vein.
     Bottom: Are we all met?
     Bottom: Let me play the lion too.
     Brief, I pray for you; for you see, 'tis a busy time with me.
     But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,
     But though the beast of game
     Calmly, as to a night's repose,
     Clown: I am gone, sire,
     Convenient place for our rehearsal.
     Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew;
     Dispel, my fair, with smiles, the tim'rous clouds,
     Dissolve the council, and their chief obey.
     Down Aaron's head, that downward went
     Edgar: Before you fight the battle ope this letter.
     Ere hound we slip, or bow we bend;
     First born of Egypt, smite did he,
     Fluellen: Kill the poys and the luggage! 'Tis expressly against
     For brethren so to dwell.
     For naught I did in hate, but all in honor.
     From the head to the beard did go;
     Full to the brim our rivers flow'd;
     Give me aid.
     Guard: Qui est là?
     He wales a portion with judicious care;
     His few surviving comrades saw
     His garment's skirts unto.
     His smile when rang their loud hurrah,
     How good it is, O see,
     I am weak - thou art strong; I am slow -
     I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
     I see them sit.
     I stand for judgment: answer, shall I have it?
     I'll be with you again.
     I'll seek a readier path.
     If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.
     In the heavens, in the clouds, oh, I see
     In the heavens, oh, I see
     In the woods, in the air, oh, I hear
     In the woods, oh, I hear
     It's like the choice ointment,
     Land of Albania! let me bend mine eyes
     Like flowers at set of sun
     Manitou! Manitou!
     Manitou! Manitou!
     Manitou! Manitou! Manitou!
     Manitou! Manitou! Manitou!
     Many clouds.
     Many spots - many dark, many red:
     Mine ear is open, and my heart prepared:
     O, Egypt! wonders sent 'midst thee,
     Of mankind, and of beast also:
     On Pharaoh and his servants too!
     On thee; thou rugged nurse of savage men!
     On yonder cliffs, a grizzly band,
     Pray you, if it be, give it to me, for I am slow of study.
     Puc: Paisans, pauvres gens de France.
     Quince: Pat-pat; and here's a marvelous
     Quince: You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
     Salarino. - Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his
     Say, is my kingdom lost?
     Shylock. - To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it
     Shylock: Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him.
     Shylock: If you deny me, fie upon your law!
     Snug: Have you the lion's part written?
     Sola, sola, wo ha, ho, sola!
     That hang on thy clear brow.
     The assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,
     The fresh and boundless wood;
     The loud whoop!
     The melody of waters fill'd
     The privilege of chase may claim;
     The prowling fox was trapped or slain?
     The web is wove. The work is done.
     The whoop, the long yell, and the cry:
     The worst is wordly loss thou canst unfold: -
     Then go we in, to know his embassy;
     Then saw in death his eyelids close
     There is no force in the decrees of Venice:
     They conquered - but Bozzaris fell,
     They do not sleep,
     They fought - like brave men, long and well,
     They linger yet,
     They piled that ground with Moslem slain,
     Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide;
     Thou art great, thou art good, thou art wise:
     Thou art just.
     Though space and law the stag we lend
     Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay
     Till I torment thee for this injury.
     Till the great king, without a ransom paid,
     To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.
     Together e'en in unity,
     Vive le vin, vive l'amour, &c., &c.
     Weave we the woof. The thread is spun.
     Well go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove

     Which I could, with ready guess, declare,
