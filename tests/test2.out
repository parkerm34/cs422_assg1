     Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,
     Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;

   " I don't care whose tick he is -- he's on my side of the line, and you

   " She! She never licks anybody -- whacks 'em over the head with her

   "'Bout what?"
   "'Deed it would, Joe. Say -- I wish the boys could see us now."
   "'Tain't a Spaniard -- it's Injun Joe!"
   "'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.
   "'Tain't thunder," said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, "becuz thunder -- "
   "'Tis well. Give the countersign."
   "'Tisn't any of your business, maybe."
   "'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one summer,"
   "A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead
   "A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were -- "
   "AIN'T it gay?" said Joe.
   "About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was
   "Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?"
   "Agreed, and good as wheat!"
   "Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?"
   "Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's very well.
   "Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool
   "All right -- it's a whiz. When do you say?"
   "All right -- that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer
   "All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what

   "All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the

   "All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?"

   "All right. It's nearly dark enough to start."
   "All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes."
   "All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little bag

   "And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here."
   "And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle along-side of Injun Joe ain't

   "And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And Joe?"
   "And me?" said Sally Rogers.
   "And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!"
   "And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!" And the

   "And you did just right," said the widow. "Come with me, boys."
   "And you do talk such stuff," Sid said. "Last night you said, 'It's

   "Answer the gentleman, Thomas -- don't be afraid."
   "Any fool knows that. I don't reckon you was the first that found it out,

   "Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the whole

   "As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!"
   "At noon. Do you go home to dinner?"
   "Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck."
   "Aunt Polly, it seemed mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth
   "Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it."
   "Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't,
   "Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it -- but I didn't think."
   "Auntie, what have I done?"
   "Aw -- take a walk!"
   "Aye-aye, sir!"
   "Aye-aye, sir!"
   "Aye-aye, sir!"
   "BLOOD!"
   "Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler
   "Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry."
   "Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon he
   "Because the bush is in your way. Now -- this way -- now you see, don't
   "Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer."
   "Becky" -- pleadingly. "Becky, won't you say something?"
   "Becky, I -- I don't care for anybody but you."
   "Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to
   "Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?"
   "Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave."
   "Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly -- well, Jim wanted to do
   "Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?"
   "Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much."
   "Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight
   "Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an

   "Blessed are the -- a -- a -- "
   "Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey and
   "Bought him off'n a boy."
   "Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick."
   "Boys, I know who's drownded -- it's us!"
   "Brother, go find your brother!"
   "But I must! Don't groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this

   "But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she
   "But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?"
   "But they don't say anything over it," said Huck. "I've seen 'em and they
   "But they don't."
   "But what will mamma say?"
   "But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to reflect
   "But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere."
   "By George, he has got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!"
   "By God, that's -- "
   "By and by. Maybe about vacation."
   "By hokey, that's so, Tom!"
   "By jingo! for two cents I will do it."
   "By jings, I wish I was over there, now," said Joe.
   "By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was now!"
   "By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have
   "Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me."
   "Can!"
   "Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?"
   "Can't!"
   "Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water
   "Cert'nly -- anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?"
   "Certainly. Of course. That's part of it. And always coming to school or
   "Certainly."
   "Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them -- and I don't know
   "Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?"
   "Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering.
   "Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?"
   "Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir."
   "Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?"
   "DAVID AND GOLIAH!"
   "Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
   "Damn her, maybe she's got company -- there's lights, late as it is."
   "Dangerous!" grunted the "deaf and dumb" Spaniard -- to the vast surprise
   "Dares to hold such language," said Tom, prompting -- for they talked "by
   "Dead cat."
   "Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a
   "Dern'd if I would," said Huck.
   "Did he say anything?"
   "Did you, Tom, did you! I just forgive you everything for that!" And she
   "Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about
   "Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?"
   "Do it now? And company there? Look here -- I'll get suspicious of you,
   "Do they always bury it as deep as this?"
   "Do they hop?"
   "Do you love rats?"
   "Do you remember this?" said he.
   "Do you though?"
   "Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it
   "Don't Tom! It's awful."
   "Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter."
   "Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more
   "Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't

   "Don't you crowd me now; you better look out."
   "Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,
   "Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream it
   "Dying!"
   "Earnest, Huck -- just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go
   "Everybody?"
   "Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?"
   "Follered 'em -- yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up -- they
   "For theirs . Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
   "For they -- a -- "
   "For they S, H -- Oh, I don't know what it is!"
   "Get away from here!"
   "Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me they
   "Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
   "Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!"
   "Go away yourself!"
   "Go for all of 'em!"
   "Go on, Tom!"
   "Good -- that's a whack. What's your name?"
   "Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's -- "
   "Good for? Cure warts with."
   "Good idea," said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,
   "Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here
   "Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy
   "Goody! ... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse
   "Got it at last!" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with his
   "Gracie Miller?"
   "Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that -- that -- "
   "Hadn't any aunt! -- you numskull. What has that got to do with it?"
   "Half-rotten plank -- no, it's a box, I believe. Here -- bear a hand and
   "Hallo, he's stopped! -- Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!"
   "Hallo, who's that?"
   "Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks
   "Hark!" said Tom. "Listen -- don't talk."
   "Have the initiation."
   "Have the which?"
   "Have you got one of them papers, Tom?"
   "Have you? What's your way?"
   "He dasn't tell! So it was a witch that done it. I just knowed it."
   "He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given name."
   "He didn't stay with us," said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A

   "Hello!" said he.
   "Hello, Huck!"
   "Hello, Huckleberry!"
   "Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?"
   "Hello, yourself."
   "Hellum-a-lee -- hard a port! Stand by to meet
   "Here it is," said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern
   "Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country.
   "Here! You're a watchman, ain't you! All right, though -- nothing's
   "Here, now, don't you hit my pard!" and the next moment he had grappled
   "Hey, Huck! -- you hear that?"
   "Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on it."
   "Hold on, now, what 'er you belting me for? -- Sid broke it!"
   "Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?"
   "Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow."
   "Holler 'nuff!" -- and the pounding went on.
   "Hop? -- your granny! No!"
   "Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me."
   "How could I know you was looking at anything?"
   "How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
   "How you talk! No!"
   "How'll she ever know?"
   "How?"
   "Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas." Tom
   "Huck and Tom Sawyer."
   "Huck don't need it. Huck's rich."
   "Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it.
   "Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but
   "Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see
   "Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!"
   "Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I don't want to -- but what would people
   "Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?"
   "Huck, have you ever told anybody about -- that?"
   "Huck, he must mean us both -- we're right together."
   "Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
   "Huck, it's in the cave!"
   "Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!"
   "Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?"
   "Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
   "Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll agree
   "Huckleberry Finn -- quick, let me in!"
   "Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge!
   "Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?"
   "Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?"
   "Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"
   "Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?"
   "Hurry, men!" he said, in a low voice; "the moon might come out at any

   "Hyro which?"
   "I -- "
   "I -- well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything."
   "I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!"
   "I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever

   "I ain't, aunt; it is all done."
   "I ain't."

   "I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore it
   "I bet you don't. What is it?"
   "I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They

   "I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep

   "I can't -- I can't do it, Huck!"
   "I can't -- I'd die if they was to wake."
   "I can't see any."
   "I can."
   "I couldn't help it -- I couldn't help it," Potter moaned. "I wanted to

   "I didn't do it, friends," he sobbed; "'pon my word and honor I never

   "I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain

   "No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?"
   "No!"
   "No'm -- well, not very much."
   "No'm."
   "No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and

   "What is it?" whispered Huck, blanching with fright.
   "What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it."

   "Where'd you get him?"

   The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
